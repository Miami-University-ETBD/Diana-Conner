  <h1> About Our Company </h1> <h2> <i> Humble Beginnings </i> </h2>

  <aside>
<p> FUN FACT!
  We still credit all of our cheese recipes to Mother Mouser who taught Mr. Mouser the sacred art of cheesemaking in 1pt Comic Sans font on the back of all of our packaging. </p>
  </aside>
  <p> Mr. Mouser has been dedicated to the cheesmaking craft since he was a small mouse. Through his many mouse friends who were excited to work for him, Mr. Mouser made connections and took a leap of faith. In 1346, he moved to West Cheeserton, MA from his hometown Cheesinatti, OH. From the ground up, he established the first mouse-ran business from a previously abandoned factory building. </p>
  <p> <b> Early Life </b> <p>
  <p> In 1344, Mr. Mouser was born and on a mission to become the first mouse millionaire. His father abandoned him at birth, and being the youngest of 8 siblings (three of which already passed from carriage accidents and the bubonic plague), he felt it was his duty to take care of his mother until her passing in 1345. When she passed, he made a promise at only one year of age to pass on her recipes. </p>

  <h2> Mr. Mouser's Legacy </h2>
<p> Mr. Mouser was so focused on his company and changing the world, that he hadn't even considered who to give the company to when he did eventually die of natural causes after living a long 7 year lifespan. he had no kin, dying in 1351 with his company associates by his side. The business was given to his assistant Carlyle mouse, then to his assistant and soforth. This system kept the business afloat until the newest CEO started in 2016 who's been supervising the company for 8 years now. <br>
  <small> **We cannot disclose who the CEO is at this time, check in later for new updates.** </small>
